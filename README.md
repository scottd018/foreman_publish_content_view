# Variables

All default variables, which are not likely to change, are stored in **./defaults/main.yml** and should be reviewed before executing a playbook, with this role.

Required variables are as follows:

**foreman_organization:** the organization that the content view belongs to

**foreman_server:**       the IP Address or Hostname used to connect to the Foreman/Satellite API

**foreman_content_view:** the name of the content view

**foreman_user:**         the user which has appropriate access to publish the content view

**foreman_password:**     the password of the user which has appropriate access to publish the content view

# Sample Inventory

**NOTE:** this role is largely dependent upon API calls and is not likely to depend on SSH connectivity, and therefore may likely depend on using `localhost` as the inventory.  One may delegate to another server if required, but `localhost` is sufficient assuming proper connectivity to the Foreman API.

# Sample Playbook

```
- hosts:        localhost
  gather_facts: false
  connection:   local
  become:       false

  roles:

    - role: foreman_publish_content_view
      vars:
        foreman_organization: 'Scott-Net'
        foreman_server:       '192.168.89.164'
        foreman_content_view: 'Test-View'
        foreman_user:         'admin'
        foreman_password:     'smartvm'
```

**NOTE:** vars can be passed in many different ways in Ansible.  This is just one example of how to accomplish this task.  Extra vars using the `-e "var1=value1 var1=value1"` is perfectly acceptable.

# Sample Usage

```
ansible-playbook -vv my_playbook.yml
```
